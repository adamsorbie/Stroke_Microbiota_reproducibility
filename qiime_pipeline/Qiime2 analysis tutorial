# Analysis of Microbiota data

This document contains code to analyse the microbiota data generated in
Sorbie, Jimenez and Benakis 2021 and is intended to act as template for
other stroke researchers to conduct their own analyses.

## Set-up 

To be able to perform these analyses you will first need to clone this repository (type ```git clone git@github.com:adamsorbie/Stroke_Microbiota_reproducibility.git```). 
You will also need a working installation of Qiime2 to follow this tutorial.
