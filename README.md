## Data processing and Analysis 

Here we provide two pipeline scripts to process 16S microbiota data. To reach a wider audience, one is written in R and the other in shell/python via QIIME2 so researchers can choose whichever they are most comfortable with. 


### Dependencies 

For the R version the following dependencies must be installed and available in your path: 

FastTree
MAFFT 

### Installation 

Although this analysis pipeline can in theory be ran on Windows 10, it works better on unix-based systems. If you are a Windows user, we recommend installing the Windows subystem for Linux.
